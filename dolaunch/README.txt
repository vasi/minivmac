DoLaunch: READMEPaul C. PrattAugust 17, 2007DoLaunch launches an application named "app" inthe same directory in System 6 or earlier.This is useful for applications that can notbe set to the Start up application, presumablydue to the bug of not initializing everythingthat needs to be.Further information may be found at"http://minivmac.sourceforge.net/extras/dolaunch.html".You can redistribute DoLaunch and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
